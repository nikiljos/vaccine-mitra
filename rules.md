I'm building this as a participant for MozWeb, a web development competition conducted by Mozilla Campus Club of SJCET in association with the Department of Computer Science, St. Joseph's College of Engineering and Technology, Palai.

Here are the guidelines for building the website for MozWeb :

The competition theme is COVID-19 vaccine awareness. Your website should educate the visitors about the need for taking the vaccine, common myths about the vaccine and about the different vaccines available. You are free to add any more content as you wish. (For eg, you can make use of the COWIN API to display vaccine availability in the visitors area)
